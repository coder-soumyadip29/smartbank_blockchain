# 🏦 Decentralized Smart Bank (On-Chain Transaction Logger)

## 📘 Overview
This project is a **simple decentralized smart bank** built using **Solidity** and deployed on the **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.  
It records **deposits** and **withdrawals** directly on-chain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and decentralization.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how blockchain technology can be used to create **trustless financial systems** that operate without intermediaries.

## 🚀 Deployment Steps (Summary)

1. Write and compile the Solidity contract using **Remix IDE**.  
2. Connect **MetaMask** wallet to **Celo Sepolia Testnet**.  
3. Deploy the contract directly via Remix with injected Web3 provider.  
4. Verify deployment via **Blockscout** using the transaction hash (see above).
